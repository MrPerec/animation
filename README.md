Demonstration of animation using the GreenSock library

This is the layout of a single-screen website that does not have an adaptive version. JavaScript animation was applied to this layout:
* Website loading animation is implemented using the GreenSock library.
* Animation of the opening of the burger menu was also applied using the same GreenSock library. The reverse() method is used to close the menu.
